# Catalyst Start Session Hook

Welcome! **Catalyst** is active - your catalyst for rapid full-stack development.

## 🚀 Catalyst Workflow

Build enterprise web apps **10x faster** with parallel agent workflows:

1. **🔥 Ignite** → Explore tech stack options in parallel
2. **🏗️ Architect** → Create detailed, parallelizable implementation plans
3. **⚡ Deploy** → Build components simultaneously with parallel agents
4. **🚀 Ship** → Integrate everything and launch your app

## 💡 Key Concepts

**Parallel Development:** Multiple agents work simultaneously on different components, dramatically reducing build time.

**Contract-Driven:** Clear API contracts and database schemas let agents work independently without coordination.

**Stack-Agnostic:** Works with any technology combination - React, Vue, .NET, Node.js, Django, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, and more.

**Proactive Activation:** Skills automatically activate based on your intent - no need to manually trigger them.

## Quick Start

**Building something new?** Just tell me what you want to build:

Examples:
- "I want to build a task management app with real-time collaboration"
- "Help me create an e-commerce platform with product catalog and checkout"
- "Build a customer portal with authentication and file uploads"

I'll automatically activate the **Catalyst workflow** and guide you through:
- Researching the best tech stack options (5-10 parallel research agents)
- Creating a comprehensive implementation plan (architecture, APIs, database)
- Deploying components in parallel for maximum speed (3-6 agents simultaneously)
- Integrating everything into a working application

**Already have a plan?** Tell me where you'd like to start:
- "Research tech stacks for [your feature]"
- "Create a plan for [your project]"
- "Deploy the plan we discussed"
- "Integrate the components"

**Need examples?** Check `/examples/` directory for complete workflow demonstrations.
