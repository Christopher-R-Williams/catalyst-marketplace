# Catalyst ⚡

**Build enterprise web apps 10x faster.** A catalyst for rapid full-stack development using parallel agent workflows.

## What is Catalyst?

Catalyst is a comprehensive Claude Code plugin that transforms how you build web applications. Instead of building sequentially, Catalyst orchestrates **parallel agents** that research, plan, and build simultaneously - dramatically accelerating development from idea to working application.

## The Catalyst Workflow

Four powerful skills that work together seamlessly:

1. **🔍 Research** (`enterprise-app-researcher`) - Launch parallel agents to explore tech stack options
2. **📋 Plan** (`enterprise-app-planner`) - Generate detailed, parallelizable implementation plans
3. **⚡ Deploy** (`parallel-deployer`) - Build multiple components simultaneously with parallel agents
4. **🔗 Integrate** (`component-integrator`) - Connect everything into a working application

**The Result:** Hours instead of days. A working full-stack application from idea to reality.

## Skills Included

### 1. enterprise-app-researcher

**Purpose**: Launch parallel research agents to brainstorm and explore technology options.

**Use when**:
- Starting a new project and need to evaluate tech stacks
- Comparing different architectural approaches
- Researching best practices for specific features
- Need to understand trade-offs between technologies

**Output**: Structured research findings with recommendations, pros/cons, and next steps.

**Example**:
```
User: "I need to build a customer portal with real-time notifications. Research my options."

Claude: Launches 5 parallel research agents:
- Frontend frameworks (React, Vue, Angular, Svelte)
- Backend frameworks (Node.js, .NET, Python, Java)
- Database options (PostgreSQL, MongoDB, etc.)
- Real-time solutions (WebSocket, SSE, push services)
- File storage (S3, Azure Blob, etc.)

Result: Comprehensive comparison with 2-3 recommended complete stack options
```

### 2. enterprise-app-planner

**Purpose**: Create detailed implementation plans optimized for parallel development.

**Use when**:
- Research is complete and tech stack is selected
- Have clear requirements and ready to start building
- Need to break down a complex feature into components
- Want to structure work for parallel execution

**Output**: Detailed plan with architecture, database schema, API contracts, and component breakdown.

**Example**:
```
User: "Create a plan for building a task management app with React, Node.js, and PostgreSQL."

Claude: Creates a comprehensive plan including:
- Architecture diagram
- Database schema (users, tasks, assignments tables)
- API contracts (10 REST endpoints with exact request/response formats)
- Component breakdown (4 parallel components)
- Integration strategy
- Testing approach

Result: Ready-to-execute plan for parallel deployment
```

### 3. parallel-deployer

**Purpose**: Execute plans by launching multiple specialized agents working simultaneously.

**Use when**:
- Implementation plan is approved and ready to execute
- Want to build components in parallel to save time
- Have a plan with clearly defined component interfaces
- Ready for actual development work

**Output**: Complete, independently developed components ready for integration.

**Example**:
```
User: "Execute this plan with parallel agents."

Claude: Launches 4 agents in a SINGLE message:
- Agent 1: Build React frontend (uses mock APIs)
- Agent 2: Build Express backend API
- Agent 3: Setup PostgreSQL database (schema + migrations)
- Agent 4: Build authentication service

Result: 4 independently working components built simultaneously
```

### 4. component-integrator

**Purpose**: Connect independently built components into a cohesive application.

**Use when**:
- Parallel deployment is complete
- Have multiple components that need connecting
- Ready to create the final integrated application
- Need to configure CORS, auth, environment variables

**Output**: Fully integrated, working application with end-to-end testing.

**Example**:
```
User: "Integrate the components."

Claude: Performs integration:
- Connects frontend to backend API
- Configures CORS
- Connects backend to database
- Sets up authentication flow
- Creates .env configuration
- Tests end-to-end
- Creates developer documentation

Result: Complete, working application ready to run
```

## Complete Workflow Example

Here's a full workflow from idea to working application:

### Step 1: Research (enterprise-app-researcher)
```
You: "I want to build an e-commerce platform with product catalog, shopping cart,
     and checkout. Research the best tech stacks."

Claude: Launches parallel research agents to explore options
→ Result: 3 recommended stack combinations with detailed comparisons
```

### Step 2: Planning (enterprise-app-planner)
```
You: "I'll go with React + Node.js + PostgreSQL. Create an implementation plan."

Claude: Creates detailed plan with:
- Database schema for products, users, carts, orders
- API contracts for all endpoints
- Component breakdown (Frontend, Backend API, Database, Payment Service, Auth)
- Parallel development phases

→ Result: Complete implementation plan
```

### Step 3: Parallel Development (parallel-deployer)
```
You: "Execute this plan with parallel agents."

Claude: Launches 5 agents in parallel:
- Frontend: React app with product browsing, cart, checkout UI
- Backend: Express API with all endpoints
- Database: PostgreSQL schema, migrations, seed data
- Payment: Stripe integration service
- Auth: JWT authentication service

→ Result: 5 independently working components
```

### Step 4: Integration (component-integrator)
```
You: "Integrate all the components."

Claude: Integrates everything:
- Connects frontend to backend
- Connects backend to database
- Configures authentication across all components
- Sets up Stripe payment flow
- Tests complete checkout process
- Creates setup documentation

→ Result: Working e-commerce application
```

## Key Benefits

### Stack-Agnostic Design
All skills adapt to any technology combination:
- Frontend: React, Vue, Angular, Svelte, or any other
- Backend: Node.js, .NET, Python, Java, or any other
- Database: PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, or any other
- Cloud: AWS, Azure, GCP, or self-hosted

### Parallel Efficiency

## Usage Tips

### 1. Start with Research
Even if you know your stack, use the researcher to validate your choices and discover alternatives.

### 2. Approve Plans Before Deployment
Review the implementation plan carefully. Changes after parallel deployment begins are costly.

### 3. Trust the Parallel Process
Don't micromanage individual agents. Let them work independently - they follow the defined contracts.

### 4. Budget Integration Time
Integration always takes time. Plan for 20-30% of development time for connecting components.

### 5. Use the Full Workflow
These skills are designed to work together. Using them in sequence maximizes benefits.

## Common Use Cases

### Starting a New Enterprise Project
1. Research → Plan → Deploy → Integrate
2. Full workflow from idea to MVP in hours instead of days

### Adding a Major Feature
1. Research approaches → Plan feature → Deploy in parallel → Integrate with existing code
2. Use parallel-deployer to build new feature modules simultaneously

### Refactoring or Modernizing
1. Research modern alternatives → Plan migration → Deploy new architecture in parallel → Integrate gradually
2. Build new system alongside old one

### Prototyping and MVP Development
1. Quick research → Minimal plan → Fast parallel deployment → Basic integration
2. Validate ideas rapidly with working prototypes

## Advanced Patterns

### Microservices Development
Use parallel-deployer to build each microservice simultaneously:
- 1 agent per service
- 1 agent for API gateway
- 1 agent for shared infrastructure
- Deploy 10+ services in parallel

### Full-Stack Monorepo
Use parallel-deployer with organized workspace:
- Frontend agent → /frontend
- Backend agent → /backend
- Database agent → /database
- Shared types → /shared

### Multi-Platform Applications
Research and deploy web + mobile simultaneously:
- Web frontend agent
- Mobile app agent (React Native/Flutter)
- Shared backend API agent
- Single source of truth for business logic

## Troubleshooting

### "Agents aren't launching in parallel"
Make sure Claude launches all agents in a SINGLE message with multiple Task tool calls.

### "Components don't integrate properly"
Check that all agents followed the API contracts defined in the plan. Most issues are contract violations.

### "Integration failing with CORS errors"
The component-integrator should handle this, but verify CORS is configured for your frontend origin.

### "Database connection issues"
Verify connection strings in .env file match your database configuration.

## Best Practices

1. **Clear Requirements**: More specific requirements = better research and planning
2. **Detailed Contracts**: API and schema definitions must be complete before deployment
3. **Parallel Limits**: 3-6 agents is optimal for most projects
4. **Version Control**: Use git from the start, commit after each phase
5. **Incremental Testing**: Test each integration point before moving to the next

## Stack-Specific Examples

### MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js)
Research → Plan with MERN → Deploy (React + Express + MongoDB agents) → Integrate

### .NET + Angular + SQL Server
Research → Plan with .NET stack → Deploy (Angular + .NET API + SQL Server agents) → Integrate

### Python Django + Vue + PostgreSQL
Research → Plan with Python stack → Deploy (Vue + Django + PostgreSQL agents) → Integrate

### Serverless (Next.js + AWS Lambda + DynamoDB)
Research → Plan with serverless → Deploy (Next.js + Lambda functions + DynamoDB agents) → Integrate
